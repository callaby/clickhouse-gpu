https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/commit/dde32f8bbc95312379f9f5a651799815bb6327c5

Several modifications:
1. Disabled TCMALLOC_AGGRESSIVE_DECOMMIT by default. It is important.
2. Using only files for tcmalloc_minimal build (./configure --enable-minimal).
3. Using some compiler flags from project.
4. Removed warning about unused variable when build with NDEBUG (by default).
5. Including config.h with relative path.
